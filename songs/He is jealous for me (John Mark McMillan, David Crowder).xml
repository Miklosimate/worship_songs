    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He is jealous for me, loves like a hurricane, <br/>I am a tree bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.<br/>When all of the sudden, I am unaware of these afflictions<br/>eclipsed by glory, and I realize just how beautiful You are,<br/>and how great are Your affecions are for me.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And oh, how He loves us oh,<br/>oh how He loves us, how he loves us all.<br/><br/>He loves us, oh how he loves us,<br/>oh how he loves us, oh how he loves.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We are his portion and He is our prize,<br/>drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,<br/>if grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.<br/>So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,<br/>and my heart turns violently inside of my chest,<br/>I don't have time to maintain these regrets,<br/>when I think about the way...</lines>
